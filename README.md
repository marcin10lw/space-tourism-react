# Marcin Augun - Space-tourism

## Description

This time I have created Space-tourism page based on one of the numerous challenges of [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3).

## Challenges

The Space Tourism website allows users to:

- View the optimal layout for each page based on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for interactive elements.
- Navigate through different pages and toggle between tabs to explore new information.

## Live Site URL: [marcin10lw.github.io/space-tourism-react](https://marcin10lw.github.io/space-tourism-react/#/home)

As always this was an excellent learning opportunity in which I could improve making responsive multi-page websites using [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

This was excellent chance to practise animations using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) library and swipe events using [React Swipeable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-swipeable).
